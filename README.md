# Sounds Be Gone!

Inspired by my own Misophonia, this mod allows you to disable any sound in the game (vanilla, modded, etc) that you don't like.

It records the sounds you've heard over the past minute of gameplay and allows you to then mute them permanently.

This is a client-side-only mod.

## Usage

If you hear something that triggers you, press ESC, click on MODS, select Sounds Be Gone, click on the settings icon on the top right hand corner and then disable the sound(s) of your choice.
